# üêç Python Introduction:

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** developed by ***Guido van Rossum in 1991***. It is widely used in Data Science because of its simplicity and powerful libraries.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Python Setup:
- Install **Python** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use **Anaconda** for data science.  
- Use **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab** for interactive coding.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python Syntax:

### üñ® Print & Comments:
```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, Data Science!")  # Prints text
```
### üìù Variables & Data Types:
Variable is like a **container** that is used to store data in your program.
  - It doesn‚Äôt need explicit declaration of type (Python figures it out automatically).
  - The value stored in a variable **can change while the program runs** ‚Äî that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called a *variable*.
```python
x = 10          # integer
y = 3.14        # float
name = "Namish" # string
is_student = True # boolean
```
Here **x, y, name, is_student** are variables. They are assigned values of different data types as mentioned in the code bloc.
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Operators:
Operators are special symbols in Python that perform operations on values or variables.
They tell Python what kind of action to perform. There are various types of operators:

### ‚úèÔ∏è Assignment Operators:
These operators basdically assign some value to the variables

### üî¢ Arithmetic Operator:
Arithmetic operators in Python are the symbols we use to perform mathematical operations on numbers.
We have many kinds of Arithmetic Operators:
```python
a = 10
b = 3
```
#### Addition (+):
It adds 'a' and 'b'
```python
print(a + b)  # Addition - It adds 'a' and 'b'.
```
```python
print(10 + 3) # Assigned the values of 'a' and 'b'.
  # Answer - 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction - It subtracts 'b' from 'a'.
print(a * b)  # Multiplication - It multilies 'a' and 'b'.
print(a / b)  # Division - It divides 'a' from 'b'.
print(a // b) # Floor Division - It divides 'a' from 'b' and rounds the answer (towards negative infinity) to the nearest whole number.
print(a % b)  # Modulus - It returns the remainder after dividing 'a' by 'b'.
print(a ** b) # Exponential - It means 'raise to the power of', it multiplies 'a' by itself ,'b' number of times
```
In the above code bloc, we can see that we **assigned values** to **'a' and 'b'**. Then, we performed the **arithmetic operations on 'a' and 'b'**. 
So, basically this is what we are trying to do:
```python
print(10+3) #
