# üéØ ADVANCED PYTHON ESSENTIALS : 

## üß† Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python :

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Classes and Objects :
---
1. **Classes** are blueprints for creating objects (instances).  \
In data science, classes help organize code for data preprocessing, model creation, and analysis pipelines.

    üß© **Example of  class :**
    ```python
    class Student:
        def __init__(self, name, marks):
            self.name = name        # Attribute
            self.marks = marks      # Attribute
        
        def display(self):          # Method
            print(f"{self.name} scored {self.marks} marks.")
    ```
    Here,
    - **self** represents **current object** of class. \
    It lets you **access variables and methods** that belong to that *specific* object.
    - **Attributes** are defining structure
    - **Method** are defining behavior
---
2. **Object** is an **instance** of a class ‚Äî it‚Äôs the actual entity created from the blueprint. \
Every object has its own **data (attributes)** and can perform **actions (methods)** defined by the class.

    üß© Example:
    ```python
    # Creating objects (instances) of the class
    s1 = Student("Namish", 90)
    s2 = Student("Riya", 85)

    # Accessing object methods
    s1.display()   # Output: Namish scored 90 marks.
    s2.display()   # Output: Riya scored 85 marks.
    ```
    Here,
    - `Student` ‚Üí Class
    - `s1`,`s2` ‚Üí Objects (Instances)
---

3. **Analogy for Understanding :**

| **Real World Example** | **OOP Concept** |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Blueprint of a building | Class|
| Actual building built from that blueprint | Object |
| Each building having different paint color, size, etc. | Object Attributes |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Instance, Class, and Static Variables : 
-  **Instance Variables**
   - Belong to each object (unique per instance).
   - Defined using `self` inside methods(usually inside `__init__`)
   - Each object has it's **own copy** of these variables.
   - Changing one object‚Äôs instance variable doesn‚Äôt affect others. \
    
   üß©**Example:**
   ```python


-  **Class Variables**
   - Shared across all instances of a class.
-  **Static Variables**
   - Defined inside class but outside any method; often constants.
